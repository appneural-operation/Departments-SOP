The SOP aims to:

1. Ensure **smooth integration** of outsourcing vendors into company processes.
2. Define **roles, responsibilities, and accountability** for task execution.
3. Standardize **task allocation, tracking, and reporting** for maximum efficiency.
4. Facilitate **knowledge transfer and proper handover** to internal teams.
5. Ensure **timely project closure** with documentation and performance evaluation.
6. Minimize operational risks and errors during outsourcing and project handovers.
