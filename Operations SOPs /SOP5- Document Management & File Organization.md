# SOP for Document Management & File Organization (Google Drive / GitHub)

**Department:** Operations / HR / Tech / Business Development  
**Purpose:**  
To ensure that all company files, project documents, and records are systematically stored, properly named, securely managed, and easily retrievable through Google Drive and GitHub.

---

## 1. Objective
The purpose of this SOP is to maintain organized, secure, and accessible document storage across all departments.  
This ensures that files are easy to locate, reduces duplication, prevents data loss, and maintains confidentiality of sensitive information.

---

## 2. Scope

- Google Drive (for HR, Operations, Business, and Admin-related documents)

## 3. Folder Hierarchy
All folders should follow a **consistent and logical structure** to help locate files quickly.

## 5. Version Control Process
Version control ensures that everyone works on the **latest and approved version** of a document.

**Steps:**
1. When making changes, create a **new version** instead of overwriting.  
2. Update the version number (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1 for small edits, v2.0 for major updates).  
3. Maintain a **Change Log** file in each department folder noting:
   - Date of update  
   - Author/editor  
   - Summary of changes  
   - Approved by  

**Example (Change Log Table):**
