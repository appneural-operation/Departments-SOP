## **4. Procedure**

### **Step 1: Identify the Hiring Need**
1. Department Head or Project Manager evaluates the teamâ€™s workload, project deadlines, and skill gaps.
2. Determine whether:
   - Itâ€™s a **new role** required due to business growth.
   - Or a **replacement role** due to resignation, transfer, or promotion.
3. Ensure the role aligns with:
   - The companyâ€™s manpower plan.
   - Current project or client requirements.
   - Departmental KPIs and performance goals.

### **Step 2: Fill Out the Job Requisition Form (JRF)**
The requesting manager must fill out the official **Job Requisition Form (JRF)** provided by HR.  
This form captures all key details needed for review and approval.

**The JRF should include:**
- Department Name and Reporting Manager  
- Designation / Job Title  
- Type of Role (Full-Time / Intern / Contract / Freelance)  
- Reason for Hiring (New / Replacement)  
- Key Roles and Responsibilities  
- Required Skills, Experience, and Qualifications  
- Expected CTC or Stipend  
- Proposed Start Date / Urgency Level  
- Any additional remarks or justifications  

Once filled, the JRF should be signed (digitally or manually) by the **Department Head** and submitted to the HR Department.

---

### **Step 3: HR Review**
After receiving the JRF, HR will:
1. **Verify Completeness:** Ensure all required details and justifications are filled.
2. **Check Role Duplication:** Confirm if the same or similar role already exists.
3. **Validate Manpower Planning:** Compare against the approved headcount.
4. **Check Salary Benchmark:** Validate the proposed salary with internal pay structure and market standards.

If discrepancies are found, HR discusses them with the requesting manager for corrections.

---

### **Step 4: Finance & Management Approval**
1. HR forwards the reviewed JRF to the **Finance Department**.
2. Finance validates whether:
   - The position fits within the current departmental budget.
   - There are no ongoing financial constraints.
3. Once confirmed, HR forwards the form to the **CEO / Management** for final approval.
4. The CEO/Management reviews:
   - Strategic alignment with company goals.
   - Budget and business justification.
5. The position is then **Approved** or **Rejected**.  
   If rejected, HR documents the reason and notifies the requesting department.

---

### **Step 5: Job Requisition Number Assignment**
Once approved:
1. HR assigns a **unique Job Requisition ID**, for example:  
```

HR-JRF-2025-001

```
2. The ID will be used throughout the recruitment lifecycle for:
- Job posting reference.
- Candidate tracking.
- Approval documentation.

---

### **Step 6: Record Keeping**
1. The approved JRF and all related documents are stored:
- Digitally: In the HR shared drive or HRIS system under  
  `HR/Recruitment/Job Requisitions/2025`
- Physically: In HRâ€™s confidential personnel files.
2. All records are to be maintained for **a minimum of 3 years** for audit purposes.
3. Only HR and management have access to these documents.

---

## **5. Compliance & Controls**
- No recruitment process (posting, sourcing, or interviewing) can begin **without an approved JRF**.
