# **SOP 2: Manpower Requisition & Approval**

---

### **Purpose**

To define a **clear and standardized process** for raising, reviewing, and approving requests for new or replacement manpower.
This ensures that all hiring decisions are **aligned with workforce planning, project needs, and company budgets**, preventing unnecessary recruitment or overspending.

---

### **Scope**

Applies to all departments of **APPNEURAL Pvt. Ltd.** for:

* New position requests
* Replacement of resigned/terminated employees
* Temporary or intern hiring requests

---

### **Process Owner**

**HR Department** (in coordination with Department Heads, Finance, and Management)

---

### **Frequency**

Whenever a department identifies the need for:

* A new position (due to growth or new project)
* Replacement of an existing employee
* Short-term manpower (interns, freelancers, or project-based roles)

---

## **Process Workflow**

---

### **Step 1: Identify Manpower Need**

* The **Department Head** identifies a requirement based on:

  * Workforce Plan or approved budget
  * Employee resignation, promotion, or transfer
  * New project, product launch, or workload increase
* Department Head confirms that internal resources cannot meet the need.

**Output:** *Manpower Need Identified*

---

### **Step 2: Raise a Manpower Requisition Form (MRF)**

* The Department Head fills out a **Manpower Requisition Form** and submits it to HR.
* The form must include:

  * Department and reporting manager
  * Position title and level
  * Employment type (Full-time, Intern, Contract, Freelance)
  * Number of positions required
  * Reason for requisition (New / Replacement / Project Need)
  * Job Description (JD) and required skills
  * Expected salary range or stipend
  * Target joining date

**Note:** For replacements, mention the *previous employee name and last working date*.

**Output:** *Completed MRF submitted to HR*

---

### **Step 3: HR Validation**

The HR team reviews the MRF for:

* Alignment with **approved workforce plan**
* **Budget availability** under HR allocation
* Accuracy of job description and position level
* Internal availability (promotion or transfer possibility)

If valid, HR logs the requisition in the **Manpower Requisition Tracker** and assigns a **unique MRF ID** for reference.

**Output:** *Validated requisition with tracking ID*

---

### **Step 4: Approval Workflow**

HR circulates the MRF for multi-level approval through the following path:

| Approval Level         | Responsibility                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Department Head**    | Confirms actual requirement and provides justification.             |
| **HR Head**            | Ensures compliance with workforce plan and recruitment feasibility. |
| **Finance Department** | Checks salary budget and financial alignment.                       |
| **Management / CEO**   | Final approval based on business and project strategy.              |

* Approvals can be done through email, HRMS, or digitally signed documents.
* HR maintains a copy of all approved requisitions for audit and tracking.

**Output:** *Approved MRF ready for action*

---

### **Step 5: Job Description Finalization**

* HR reviews the JD provided by the department to ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
* JD must include:

  * Key roles and responsibilities
  * Required skills, tools, or technologies
  * Educational and experience requirements
  * KPIs or performance indicators
* Once finalized, HR uploads it to the company drive and uses it for recruitment posting.

**Output:** *Final JD ready for recruitment posting*

---

### **Step 6: Handover to Recruitment Team**

* HR shares the approved MRF and JD with the **Recruitment Team** to initiate sourcing.
* Recruitment Team updates the **Requisition Tracker** with:

  * Opening date
  * Assigned recruiter
  * Status (Open / In Process / Closed)

**Output:** *Recruitment process officially initiated*

---

### **Step 7: Tracking & Status Updates**

* HR regularly tracks requisition status:

  * **Open:** Sourcing ongoing
  * **On Hold:** Awaiting budget/approval
  * **Closed:** Candidate joined or request cancelled
* Weekly reports shared with Management and Department Heads.

**Output:** *Weekly MRF Status Report*

---

### **Step 8: Closure**

* Once a candidate joins, HR:

  * Updates tracker as ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù
  * Links MRF ID with the new employee record
  * Files the completed MRF and approval chain in the HR repository

**Output:** *Closed requisition with complete documentation*
