This SOP ensures that HR resources are used efficiently, costs remain within company limits, and manpower planning aligns with financial capability.

---

### **Scope**

Applies to all HR functions and cost areas, including:

* Recruitment & selection
* Employee compensation & benefits
* Training & development
* Employee engagement & welfare
* HR systems, compliance, and administrative costs

---

### **Process Owner**

**HR Department (HR Head / Manager)** in coordination with **Finance Department** and **Top Management**

---

### **Frequency**

* **Annually:** HR budget prepared for the upcoming financial year
* **Quarterly:** Budget review and adjustment based on actual expenses

---

## **Process Workflow**

---

### **Step 1: Data Collection & Requirement Gathering**

HR collects and reviews data from the following sources:

* **Workforce Plan** (approved headcount for the year)
* **Previous Year‚Äôs HR Budget & Expense Reports**
* **Upcoming Projects / Client Contracts** (new manpower or training needs)
* **Employee Engagement Calendar & Training Calendar**
* **Policy Changes** (e.g., increments, insurance, benefits, etc.)

**Output:** *Raw data for HR budget estimation*

---

### **Step 2: Categorization of HR Expenses**

HR divides the total budget into **specific cost heads** for clarity and control:

| **Category**                      | **Examples of Expenses Included**                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Recruitment & Hiring**          | Job portals, recruitment agency fees, referral bonuses, background checks |
| **Compensation & Benefits**       | Salaries, allowances, insurance, PF, gratuity, incentives                 |
| **Training & Development**        | Workshops, GenAI training, certifications, software tools                 |
| **Employee Engagement & Welfare** | Team activities, gifts, health checkups, events                           |
| **HR Operations & Systems**       | HRMS tools, software licenses, subscriptions                              |
| **Compliance & Legal**            | Labour law filings, consultant fees, audits                               |

**Output:** *Cost category structure prepared for budget planning*

---

### **Step 3: Budget Estimation**

HR estimates the cost under each category using:

* **Historical data** from the previous year
* **Forecasted manpower cost** (new and existing employees)
* **Vendor quotations** for HR tools or services
* **Training and welfare program plans**

**Formula for Estimation:**

> Estimated Cost = (Planned Headcount √ó Average Cost per Employee) + Additional Program Expenses

HR then consolidates all estimated costs in an **HR Budget Sheet** (Excel/Google Sheet).

**Output:** *Preliminary HR Budget Estimate*

---

### **Step 4: Internal Review & Justification**

* HR prepares a **Budget Justification Note** explaining:

  * Need for each expense head
  * Key initiatives (e.g., AI training, hiring drives, ESOP plans)
  * Expected ROI or impact on employee performance
* The HR Head reviews and revises the proposed budget based on organizational priorities.

**Output:** *HR Budget Justification Document*

---

### **Step 5: Coordination with Finance Department**

* HR shares the **draft budget** with the **Finance Team** for validation.
* Finance reviews:

  * Cost feasibility
  * Cash flow projections
  * Comparison with company‚Äôs financial targets
* Discussions held between HR & Finance to finalize adjustments.

**Output:** *Finance-reviewed HR Budget Draft*

---

### **Step 6: Management Approval**

* The revised HR budget is presented to **Top Management/CEO** for final approval.
* Upon approval, the **Final HR Budget Sheet** is:

  * Digitally signed by HR Head, Finance Head, and CEO
  * Stored securely in company records

**Output:** *Final Approved HR Budget for FY [Year]*

---

### **Step 7: Budget Allocation & Communication**

* HR allocates the approved budget across:

  * Recruitment
  * Employee Salaries
  * Training
  * Engagement & Operations
* Department-wise budget limits (if applicable) are communicated.
* Budget Tracker is created for monthly monitoring.

**Output:** *HR Budget Allocation Report*

---

### **Step 8: Monthly Monitoring & Expense Tracking**

* HR maintains an **HR Budget Tracker** to record:

  * Actual expenses vs. planned
  * Monthly variance (in ‚Çπ and %)
* Major deviations (>10%) are analyzed and justified to Management.
* Adjustments or reallocation requests are made through Finance if required.

**Output:** *Monthly HR Budget Variance Report*

---

### **Step 9: Quarterly Review & Adjustment**

* Every quarter, HR and Finance review:

  * Actual spending vs. approved budget
  * Project or staffing changes
  * Training or event additions
* A **Revised Budget Report** is prepared if major deviations exist.

**Output:** *Quarterly HR Budget Review Report*

---

### **Step 10: Annual Evaluation**

At the end of the financial year:

* HR performs an **Annual Budget Evaluation**
* Identify areas of:

  * Over-spending
  * Under-utilization
  * Missed initiatives
* Learnings documented to improve next year‚Äôs planning accuracy.

**Output:** *Annual HR Budget Evaluation Report*

5. **Maintain Transparency**

   * Document every expense head clearly with justification and expected outcomes.

6. **Monitor Monthly**

   * Regular monitoring helps control overspending and allows timely reallocations.

7. **Keep 5‚Äì10% Contingency**

   * Reserve a small portion for unplanned needs like emergency hires or compliance costs.

8. **Digitize Budget Tracking**

   * Use Google Sheets or HRMS dashboards to track real-time spending and generate automatic variance reports.

9. **Conduct Cost-Benefit Reviews**

   * Evaluate ROI for major HR expenses (e.g., training impact, recruitment efficiency).

10. **Ensure Documentation & Audit Readiness**

* Keep all budget-related files (approvals, trackers, reports) well-documented for audit compliance and future reference.
