2. **Gather Evidence:** Emails, records, attendance, CCTV, documents
3. **Interview Parties:** Complainant, respondent, witnesses
4. **Prepare Investigation Report:** Include facts, evidence, and recommended resolution

**Timeline:** 7–14 days depending on complexity

---

### **Step 5: Resolution**

Based on investigation, HR recommends action:

* **Counselling / Coaching:** Minor interpersonal issues
* **Verbal or Written Warning:** Policy or behavioural issues
* **Mediation:** Neutral third-party intervention for disputes
* **Process or Policy Update:** Systemic issues identified
* **Escalation:** Serious or unresolved cases sent to senior leadership or ICC

**Timeline:** Resolution communicated within 3 days post-investigation

### **Step 6: Escalation**
