| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Goal Setting**             | Define **SMART goals** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) aligned to team and company objectives. Include KPIs and competencies. | Employee & Manager | Start of appraisal period (e.g., April 1) |
| **Ongoing Feedback**         | Managers provide continuous feedback on performance, behavioral competencies, and skill gaps.                                                          | Manager            | Quarterly / Monthly                       |
| **Mid-Year Review**          | Formal check-in to evaluate goal progress, provide coaching, and adjust goals if required.                                                             | Manager & HR       | Mid-cycle (e.g., September)               |
| **Self-Assessment**          | Employee submits self-evaluation against goals, KPIs, and competencies. Highlight achievements, challenges, and learning needs.                        | Employee           | 1 month before year-end appraisal         |
| **Manager Evaluation**       | Managers review performance using **ratings, competency assessment, and goal achievement data**.                                                       | Manager            | 3–4 weeks before appraisal cycle ends     |
| **Calibration & Moderation** | HR and senior leadership review manager ratings to ensure **consistency, fairness, and removal of bias**.                                              | HR & Leadership    | 2–3 weeks before final review             |
| **Feedback & Discussion**    | One-on-one meeting to communicate ratings, discuss strengths and improvement areas, and define **development plan**.                                   | Manager & Employee | Appraisal month (e.g., March)             |

## **5. Appraisal Methods**

### **5.1 Rating Scale**

| Rating                   | Description                                                               | Weight / Impact |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 5 – Outstanding          | Exceeds expectations consistently; demonstrates leadership and innovation | High            |
| 4 – Exceeds Expectations | Performs above expectations; contributes significantly                    | Moderate-High   |
| 3 – Meets Expectations   | Achieves goals and delivers acceptable performance                        | Standard        |
| 2 – Needs Improvement    | Below expectations; requires development support                          | Moderate        |
| 1 – Unsatisfactory       | Fails to meet objectives; immediate improvement required                  | Critical        |
