* Timesheet and productivity tracking (for applicable functions)
* Integration with payroll and compliance systems

---

## **5. Attendance Management Process**

### **5.1 Work from Office (WFO)**

* Attendance is marked **via biometric or access card system** upon entry and exit.
* Employees must:

  * Clock in before shift start time.
  * Clock out at shift end time.
  * Use HRMS attendance regularization in case of missed punches.
* Grace period of **up to 10 minutes** allowed, maximum **3 times per month**.
* Late marks beyond grace limit will be counted as **Half Day** or as per company policy.
* Absence for full day without prior approval → **Leave Without Pay (LWP)**.

---

### **5.2 Work from Home (WFH)**

* Attendance shall be captured through **HRMS login/logout, project time tracker, or daily report submission.**
* Employees must:

  * Log in within the official start time window.
  * Stay available online during core working hours (e.g., 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM).
  * Attend all virtual meetings and remain responsive on official communication channels (Teams/Slack/Email).
* Managers will verify WFH attendance via system logs and daily status reports.
* Any absence or disconnection without approval will be treated as **unauthorized absence**.

---

### **5.3 Hybrid Work Model**

* Employees following hybrid schedules (mix of WFO and WFH days) must comply with respective attendance protocols on designated days.
* HR maintains a **Hybrid Work Roster** approved by department heads.
* Attendance compliance is reviewed weekly to ensure accurate payroll input.

---

### **5.4 Attendance Regularization**

* In case of missed punch, technical issue, or official duty outside the office:

  * Employee raises a **Regularization Request** in HRMS within **2 working days**.
  * Supporting evidence (e.g., client visit email, travel plan, or supervisor confirmation) must be attached.
  * HR validates and approves after line manager’s recommendation.
