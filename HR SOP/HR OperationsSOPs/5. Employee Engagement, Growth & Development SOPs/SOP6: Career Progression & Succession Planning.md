## **5. Policy Statement**

The organization is committed to creating a **performance-driven and growth-oriented culture** that offers fair opportunities for career advancement while ensuring leadership continuity through systematic succession planning.

---

## **6. Process Flow**

### **Step 1: Identification of Career Paths**

* HR, in consultation with Department Heads, develops **career path frameworks** for all major job families.
* Each career path defines:

  * Progression routes (vertical and lateral)
  * Required competencies, qualifications, and experience levels
  * Training and skill requirements for advancement

---

### **Step 2: Performance & Potential Assessment**

* Career progression decisions are based on a **dual assessment**:

  1. **Performance Evaluation:** From annual performance appraisal results.
  2. **Potential Evaluation:** Based on behavioral traits, leadership ability, learning agility, and aspiration.

* HR uses a **9-Box Talent Matrix** to plot employees (Performance vs. Potential).

| Box           | Category             | Action                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 9 (High/High) | Future Leader        | Fast-track development |
| 6–8           | Key Contributor      | Development-focused    |
| 3–5           | Consistent Performer | Maintain and upskill   |
| 1–2           | Underperformer       | Improvement plan       |

---

### **Step 3: Talent Review Discussion**

* Conducted **annually** by HR and Department Heads.
* Review includes:

  * Current performance and future potential
  * Readiness level for next role
  * Development needs and support plans
* Output: A **Talent Inventory Report** with successor nominations for key roles.

---

### **Step 4: Individual Development Planning (IDP)**

* For each identified employee (especially HiPos or successors), create an **Individual Development Plan** that includes:

  * Learning goals and competencies to develop
  * Training, mentorship, and project assignments
  * Timeframes and evaluation checkpoints
* IDPs are reviewed semi-annually to track progress.

---

### **Step 5: Career Progression Implementation**

Career progression may occur through:

1. **Promotion:** Based on demonstrated capability, readiness, and business need.
2. **Role Enrichment:** Expanding current role responsibilities.
3. **Lateral Movement:** Cross-functional exposure for skill broadening.
4. **Special Projects / Job Rotations:** Developmental assignments to build leadership capabilities.

Promotion eligibility is determined by:

* Minimum tenure in current role
* Consistent performance rating (“Meets Expectations” or above)
* Competency and behavioral alignment
* Endorsement by HOD and HR Head

---

### **Step 6: Succession Planning for Key Positions**

* HR and leadership jointly identify **critical positions** (roles essential for business continuity).
* For each, define:

  * Key competencies
  * Successor candidates (primary and backup)
  * Readiness levels
  * Development actions
* Succession data is maintained in a **Succession Planning Matrix** and reviewed annually.

Example:

| Position      | Current Holder | Successor 1 | Successor 2 | Readiness | Development Plan                        |

| Finance Head  | Ms. D          | Mr. E       | -           | 2 years   | Mentorship + external certification     |

---

### **Step 7: Monitoring and Review**

* HR tracks the progress of IDPs, HiPo development, and promotion timelines.
* Quarterly review meetings with HODs and HR Head to ensure progress and address bottlenecks.
* Annual update of the **Talent and Succession Dashboard** shared with top management.

---

### **Step 8: Communication & Transparency**
