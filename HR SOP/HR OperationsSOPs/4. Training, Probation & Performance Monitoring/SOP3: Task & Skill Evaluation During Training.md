2. **Define task expectations** clearly:

   * Deliverables, format, quality standards.
   * Deadlines and dependencies.
3. Ensure tasks **incrementally increase in complexity** as skills develop.

| Employee Name | Task Name | Description | Expected Outcome | Deadline | Assigned By |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------- | ----------- |
|               |           |             |                  |          |             |

2. **Feedback Sessions:**

   * Mentor + HR reviews progress with employee.
   * Discuss strengths, weaknesses, and corrective actions.
3. **Document observations** in a centralized tracker.

**Template – Mid-Training Feedback Form:**

| Employee Name | Task Completed | Performance Rating | Feedback | Action Plan |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
|               |                |                    |          |             |

---

### **Stage 4: Final Task & Skill Evaluation**

   * Review all tasks, assessments, and projects.
   * Evaluate overall skill development and task efficiency.

2. **Evaluation Discussion:**

   * HR + Manager + Mentor conducts formal review with employee.
   * Highlight achievements, areas for improvement, and readiness for full-time role.

| Employee Name | Skills Evaluated | Average Rating | Strengths | Areas for Improvement | Final Recommendation |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
|               |                  |                |           |                       |                      |

### **Stage 5: Reporting & Documentation**

1. HR compiles **final training evaluation reports** for management review.
2. Maintain **records in HRMS / Drive / GitHub** (aligned with SOP 14).
3. Reports serve for:

   * Decision-making for confirmation, extension, or termination.
   * Future role allocation and skill development planning.
