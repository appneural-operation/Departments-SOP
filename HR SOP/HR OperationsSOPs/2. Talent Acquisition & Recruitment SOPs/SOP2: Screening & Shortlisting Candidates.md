## **🔟 Best Practices**

1. **Follow a Two-Level Screening System**

   * HR screens resumes → Department validates → HR finalizes.

2. **Use Keyword-Based Filtering**

   * Use Boolean searches or filters (skills, location, experience) for faster sorting.

3. **Prioritize Internal Candidates**

   * Always check for internal promotion or transfer before sourcing externally.

4. **Ensure Data Consistency**

   * Use same naming convention in all trackers (e.g., *Firstname_Lastname_Role*).

5. **Promote Diversity & Fairness**

   * Screen purely based on skill & merit, not gender, location, or college background.

6. **Maintain a “Potential for Future” List**

   * Candidates not selected but showing promise can be added to a *Talent Pool Database*.

7. **Keep Department Informed**

   * Share status updates twice a week to align HR and technical expectations.

8. **Confidentiality First**

   * Do not share candidate resumes externally or with unrelated staff.

9. **Regular Calibration Meetings**

   * Conduct monthly review sessions with department heads to refine shortlisting criteria.

10. **Automate Where Possible**

* Use filters, HRIS systems, or Google Sheets scripts to sort and score resumes efficiently.
