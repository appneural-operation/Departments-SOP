## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

---

### **Stage 1: Preparation Before Joining**

1. **HR collects onboarding info:**

   * Employee name, role, department, joining date, reporting manager, and buddy.
2. **HR shares access request sheet with IT/Admin** including:

   * Role-specific system requirements.
   * Email alias / username requirements.
   * Hardware allocation (laptop, peripherals).
3. **IT/Admin verifies system readiness** for provisioning before the joining day.

---

### **Stage 2: ID Card Creation**

**Steps:**

1. Admin prints **Employee ID Card** including:

   * Employee Name
   * Employee ID
   * Department & Role
   * Photo (collected during SOP 11)
   * Company Logo & QR Code (optional for attendance)
2. **Assign ID Number / Badge Number** consistent with HRMS/Payroll.
3. **Prepare physical card** and include in welcome kit or hand over on Day 1.
4. **Update HR tracker** with ID card issued date and status.

**Template – ID Card Details Table:**

| Employee Name | Employee ID | Role | Department | Photo Provided | ID Issued Date | Status |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ |
|               |             |      |            |                |                |        |

### **Stage 3: Company Email Creation**

**Steps:**

1. IT creates company email account based on naming convention:

   * Example: [first.last@company.com](mailto:first.last@company.com)
2. Configure email account with:

   * Default password
   * Mailbox settings (signature, folder setup)
   * Security protocols (2FA, password change on first login)
3. Share **login credentials securely** with employee via:

   * Password-protected document
   * Secure portal / temporary access
4. IT updates **email account provisioning tracker**.

**Template – Email Account Provisioning Tracker:**

| Employee Name | Email Address | Username | Temporary Password | Created By | Date | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---- | ------ |
|               |               |          |                    |            |      |        |

### **Stage 4: System Access Creation**

**Systems / Tools Accessed:**

* HRMS (Zoho, Freshteam)
* Project Management (Jira, Trello, Asana)
* Code Repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
* Communication Tools (Slack, Teams, Zoom)
* Shared Drives (Google Drive / SharePoint)
* Department-specific tools (CRM, Design, Development Tools)

**Steps:**

1. IT/admin grants **role-based access** according to department and designation.
2. Ensure **proper folder access** for document storage and project files.
3. Configure **software licenses / cloud access**.
4. HR confirms employee **receives all necessary credentials**.

**Template – System Access Tracker:**

| Employee Name | System / Tool | Access Level | Username | Password | Granted By | Date | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ---- | ------ |
|               |               |              |          |          |            |      |        |

---

### **Stage 5: Verification & Handover**

1. **On Day 1**, employee verifies:

   * ID card received
   * Email account working
   * System access functioning
   * Hardware/software allocated
2. Employee signs **Acknowledgment Form**:

   * Confirming receipt of all credentials, hardware, and access.
   * Agrees to company security and IT policies.

**Acknowledgment Template:**

> I, [Employee Name], confirm that I have received my **ID card, company email, system access credentials, and required hardware**. I agree to comply with company IT and data security policies.

### **Stage 6: Escalation & Issue Handling**

| Issue                              | Action                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Email account not working          | IT troubleshoots within 24 hours, HR escalates if unresolved |
| System access incomplete           | IT grants missing access and updates tracker                 |
| Hardware missing or malfunctioning | Admin provides replacement immediately                       |
| Credentials not received           | HR follows up, reissues securely                             |

---

### **Stage 7: Documentation & Record-Keeping**

| Document                              | Storage                  | Retention |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| ID Card Issue Records                 | HR Drive / HRMS          | 3 years   |
| Email Account & System Access Tracker | IT / HRMS                | 3 years   |
| Hardware Allocation Logs              | Admin / HR Drive         | 3 years   |
| Employee Acknowledgment Form          | HR Drive / Employee File | 3 years   |

---

### **Stage 8: Best Practices**

1. **Create access accounts 1–2 days before joining** to avoid delays.
2. Use **standardized naming conventions** for emails, IDs, and usernames.
3. Ensure **role-based access only**, avoiding unnecessary permissions.
4. Track all provisioning in a **centralized tracker**.
5. Verify **all credentials with employee** on Day 1.
6. Escalate missing or faulty access **immediately** to IT/Admin.
7. Maintain **confidentiality** of credentials and sensitive information.

---

### **Stage 9: Expected Outcomes**

* Employee receives **all IDs, emails, and system access** on or before joining.
* Ready to start work **without delay**.
* HR, IT, and Admin maintain **audit-ready records**.
* **Security and compliance** maintained through proper access provisioning.
