### **Stage 1: Employee Record Creation (Onboarding Stage)**

1. **Collect Documents** (SOP 11):

   * ID proofs, educational certificates, offer letter, NDA, personal details.

2. **Create Employee Folder Structure** in **Drive / GitHub / HRMS**:

**Standard Folder Structure:**

```
HR_Records/
 └── Employees/
      └── [Employee_Name]_[EmployeeID]/
           ├── Personal_Info/
           ├── Offer_Letter/
           ├── NDA_Confidentiality/
           ├── Payroll_Records/
           ├── Performance_Reviews/
           ├── Training_Certificates/
           └── Exit_Records/
```

3. **Upload verified documents** to respective folders.
4. **Update HRMS record** with personal and role-specific details.
5. **Set access permissions** according to role (HR, IT, Management).

### **Stage 2: HRIS Data Entry & Updates**

1. Enter data into **HRMS / ERP**:

   * Personal info: Name, DOB, Address, Contact.
   * Employment info: Designation, Department, Joining date, Reporting manager.
   * Compensation info: Salary, benefits, ESOP (if applicable).
   * Access info: Email, system access, hardware allocation.

2. Regular updates:

   * Promotions, transfers, salary changes.
   * Training or certification updates.
   * Leave and attendance logs.

**Template – HRMS Update Tracker:**

| Employee Name | Field Updated | Updated By | Date | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---- | ----- |
|               |               |            |      |       |

---

### **Stage 3: Drive / GitHub Record Management**

1. Maintain **folder permissions** based on department, HR, IT, and management access.
2. **Version control** for documents using:

   * Google Drive version history
   * GitHub commits for SOPs or policy documents
3. Standardize **file naming convention**:

   * `[EmployeeID]_[Document_Type]_[YYYY-MM-DD].pdf`
4. **Backup files** regularly:

   * Daily / weekly backup to secure cloud storage or server.

**Template – Drive/GitHub Folder Access Log:**

| Folder | Employee Name | Access Level | Granted By | Date | Notes |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---- | ----- |
|        |               |              |            |      |       |

---

### **Stage 4: Data Security & Confidentiality**

1. **Role-based access**: Only authorized personnel can access sensitive folders.
2. Encrypt sensitive documents and use password-protected files where applicable.
3. Regular **audits of access logs** to prevent unauthorized usage.
4. Follow SOP 13 for **data privacy and confidentiality compliance**.

---

### **Stage 5: Record Retrieval & Reporting**

1. HR can retrieve employee documents for:

   * Payroll, legal compliance, audits, internal reporting.
2. Use HRMS / Drive / GitHub to generate:

   * Employee lists, document verification reports, policy acknowledgment logs.

**Template – Document Retrieval Request:**

| Requested By | Employee Name | Document Type | Purpose | Date | Status |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
|              |               |               |         |      |        |

---

### **Stage 6: Offboarding / Exit Record Management**

1. Upon resignation or termination (SOP for Employee Separation):

   * Move employee folder to `Ex-Employees` archive folder.
   * Update HRMS with exit date, final settlement, and clearance status.
   * Maintain records for **3–5 years** post-employment.
2. Revoke **system access**, collect hardware, and ensure NDA compliance.

**Template – Exit Record Checklist:**

| Employee Name | ID Card Returned | System Access Revoked | Documents Archived | Final Settlement Done | Notes |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ----- |
|               |                  |                       |                    |                       |       |

### **Stage 7: Best Practices**

1. Standardize **naming conventions and folder structures** for all employee records.
2. Maintain **centralized HRIS** with sync to Drive / GitHub for document storage.
3. Conduct **quarterly audits** to verify accuracy and completeness.
