- **Collaboration & Documentation:** Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, Confluence  
- **Metrics & Reporting:** Jira dashboards, Power BI, Excel, SharePoint reports  
- **Security Tools:** SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Snyk, Fortify  

---

## 5. Bug Lifecycle & Status Definitions
A **structured lifecycle** ensures consistency in handling bugs.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New | Bug is reported, awaiting review and assignment |
| Triaged | Team Lead / PM reviews severity, priority, and assigns developer |
| Assigned | Bug assigned to developer for resolution |
| In Progress | Developer actively working on fixing the bug |
| Fixed / Resolved | Developer completes fix, code committed, ready for QA |
| Verified | QA validates fix in appropriate environment, regression tested |
| Closed | Bug confirmed fixed, no further action required |
| Reopened | Bug persists after verification or recurs |

---

## 6. Severity & Priority Classification

**Severity** measures **impact**, **Priority** measures **urgency**:

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Critical | System crash, data loss, major security vulnerability |
| High | Major functionality broken, affects multiple users |
| Medium | Minor functionality impacted, workarounds exist |
| Low | Cosmetic/UI or minor non-functional issues |

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| P1 | Must fix immediately; blocks workflow or deployment |
| P2 | Fix required in current sprint/release |
| P3 | Fix can be scheduled for future release |
| P4 | Low-priority or cosmetic fixes |

> Combine severity & priority to determine **sprint inclusion and escalation level**.

---

## 7. Bug Reporting Process (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1: Identify the Bug**
- Observed by Developer, QA, PO, or End-User
- Verify reproducibility before logging  

**Step 2: Log the Bug**
- Tool: Jira / Bugzilla / ClickUp  
- Required fields:  
  - **Title / Summary:** Short, descriptive  
  - **Description:** Detailed steps to reproduce  
  - **Environment:** Dev / Staging / Prod  
  - **Severity & Priority:** As per classification  
  - **Attachments:** Screenshots, logs, videos, or test data  
  - **Linked Task / Story ID:** For traceability  

**Step 3: Review & Triage**
- Team Lead or PM reviews bug for:  
  - Correct severity & priority  
  - Assigns to **responsible developer**  
  - Ensures no duplication in bug tracker  

**Step 4: Developer Analysis**
- Developer performs **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:  
  - Identify **technical cause**: code bug, misconfiguration, third-party issue  
  - Document preliminary findings in bug tracking tool  
- Developer updates **status to In Progress**

---

## 8. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

**Step 1: Document Problem**
- Reproduce issue  
- Identify modules, components, or dependencies affected  

**Step 2: Analyze Cause**
- Use techniques like **5 Whys**, **Fishbone Diagram**  
- Categorize cause: Code, Environment, Requirement, or Process gap  

**Step 3: Implement Corrective Action**
- Fix code or configuration  
- Apply **unit and integration tests**  
- Ensure fix does not introduce new issues  

**Step 4: Implement Preventive Action**
- Update documentation, coding standards, or testing procedures  
- Conduct team knowledge sharing sessions  

**RCA Template**
```

## RCA for Bug ID: [Insert ID]

Description of Issue:

* [Detailed description]

Impact:

* [Users / Systems affected]

Root Cause:

* [Technical / Process / Requirement cause]

Corrective Actions:

* [Immediate fix steps]

Preventive Actions:

* [Process improvements to prevent recurrence]

Responsible: [Name]
Date: [MM/DD/YYYY]

```

---

## 9. QA Validation & Closure

**Step 1: Verification**
- QA tests bug fix in **staging or testing environment**  
- Run **regression suite** for related modules  
- Log verification results in bug tracker  

**Step 2: Closure**
- Team Lead / PM reviews QA results  
- Updates bug status to **Closed**  
- If bug persists, status updated to **Reopened**  

**Bug Verification Template**
```

## Bug Verification Log

Bug ID: [Insert ID]
Tester: [Name]
Environment: [Dev / Staging / Prod]

Steps Verified:

* [Step 1]
* [Step 2]
* [Step 3]

Result: [Pass/Fail]
Comments: [Optional Notes]
Status: [Verified / Closed / Reopened]

```

## 10. Metrics & Reporting

**Key Metrics to Track:**  
| Metric | Definition | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) | Avg. time from bug creation to closure | Track efficiency of resolution process |
| Reopen Rate | % of bugs reopened after closure | Measure quality of fixes |
| Severity Distribution | # of bugs per severity | Identify critical areas needing improvement |
| SLA Compliance | % of P1/P2 bugs resolved on time | Ensure high-priority issues are addressed promptly |

**Reporting Tools:**  
- Jira / ClickUp dashboards  
- Excel / Power BI for trend analysis  
- SharePoint for **centralized reporting and audit logs**  

---

## 11. Escalation Process

1. **Critical / P1 Bugs:**  
   - Escalate immediately to Team Lead, PM, and DevOps  
   - Notify stakeholders via **Teams / Email**  
2. **High Priority / P2 Bugs:**  
   - Address in current sprint with team discussion  
3. **Repeated / Reopened Bugs:**  
   - RCA conducted; preventive action documented  
   - Team process improvements implemented  

---

## 12. Documentation & Collaboration
- **Bug logs:** Jira/Bugzilla/ClickUp  
- **RCA documents:** SharePoint / Confluence  
- **Metrics dashboards:** Jira / Power BI  
- **Communication:** Microsoft Teams for daily updates and urgent issues  

---

## 13. Continuous Improvement
- Conduct **quarterly bug trend analysis**  
- Update SOP to reduce MTTR, reopen rate, and critical bugs  
- Conduct **knowledge sharing sessions** on root causes and best practices
