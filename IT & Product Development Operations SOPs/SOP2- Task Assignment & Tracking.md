- All **projects managed by APPNEURAL Pvt. Ltd.**  
- All team members responsible for **creating, executing, reviewing, or tracking tasks**  
- Applicable for **internal and client-facing projects**  

It covers the **full task lifecycle**, including creation, assignment, tracking, reporting, and closure.

---

## **3. Applicable Tools & Platforms**
- **Primary Task Management Platforms:** Jira, Trello, ClickUp  
- **Microsoft 365 Tools:**  
  - **Planner:** Task creation, assignment, tracking within Teams  
  - **To Do:** Individual task management  
  - **SharePoint:** Documentation, file sharing, and reporting  
  - **Teams:** Communication, notifications, and alerts  
- **Time Tracking & Reporting Tools:** Toggl, Clockify, Power BI dashboards  
- **Purpose:** Ensure **real-time task updates, centralized documentation, productivity tracking**, and transparent reporting

---

## **4. Key Objectives**
1. Assign tasks **clearly to responsible individuals**  
2. Maintain visibility of task **progress at all stages**  
3. Ensure tasks are completed **on time and as per quality standards**  
4. Facilitate **team coordination** and avoid overlapping responsibilities  
5. Track **performance metrics** and generate reports for continuous improvement

---

## **5. Roles & Responsibilities**

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| Project Manager (PM) | Oversees task assignments, monitors progress, ensures deadlines are realistic |
| Team Lead / Tech Lead | Assigns technical tasks, reviews progress, validates completion |
| Individual Contributors (Developers/Designers/QA) | Complete tasks on time, update task status, communicate blockers |
| QA Lead | Assign testing tasks, monitor defect resolutions |
| Business Analyst (BA) | Create requirement-related tasks and clarify specifications |
| Operations / PMO | Generate reports, analyze metrics, update dashboards, manage Microsoft 365 tools |

---

## **6. Task Management Hierarchy**
Tasks should follow a **structured hierarchy**:  
1. **Epics** – Large features or modules  
2. **Stories** – Specific functionality or user requirement  
3. **Tasks** – Individual actionable work items  
4. **Subtasks** – Smaller steps under each task  

**Purpose:** Ensure **all work is traceable** from high-level features down to individual actions.

---

## **7. Workflow Stages**
Tasks progress through the following **stages**:  
1. **To Do** – Task is created and ready to start  
2. **In Progress** – Task is actively worked on  
3. **Review / QA** – Task completed but pending review/testing  
4. **Done / Closed** – Task verified and approved  

**Guidelines:**  
- Only the assigned team member moves tasks to **In Progress**.  
- QA or Team Lead moves tasks to **Done** after validation.  
- **Comments and updates** are mandatory for transparency.

---

## **8. Task Assignment & Accountability**
- Tasks are **created by PM, BA, or Team Lead** depending on type.  
- Each task has **one primary owner** with clear accountability.  
- Deadlines must align with **project milestones**.  
- **RACI Matrix** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) is recommended for complex tasks.

---

## **9. Task Priority & Deadlines**
- **Priority Levels:** Critical, High, Medium, Low  
- **Critical/High Priority:** Must meet sprint/milestone deadlines  
- **Medium/Low Priority:** Scheduled in backlog or later sprints  
- Delays must be **communicated immediately** with updated timelines

---

## **10. Task Tracking & Reporting**
- Update **task status in real-time** using platforms (Jira/Trello/ClickUp) and **Microsoft 365 Planner**  
- **Daily Updates:** Team members update progress and blockers  
- **Weekly Reports:** PM/Operations generates:  
  - Completed vs. pending tasks  
  - Task aging (time in each stage)  
  - Sprint/milestone velocity  
- **Dashboards & Reports:**  
  - Jira Dashboard, ClickUp Dashboard, Power BI, Microsoft 365 SharePoint Reports  
- **Metrics Tracked:**  
  - Task completion rate  
  - Average task aging  
  - Team/sprint velocity  
  - Resource utilization

---

## **11. Integration with Time-Tracking Tools**
- Track hours using **Toggl or Clockify**, linked to tasks  
- Daily logging ensures **accurate effort estimation**  
- Use data to **analyze productivity, identify bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation**

---

## **12. Performance Measurement**
- **Individual Metrics:** Task completion rate, timeliness, quality of updates  
- **Team Metrics:** Sprint velocity, milestone completion, task aging  
- **Project Metrics:** Total tasks completed vs. planned, backlog reduction  
- Reviewed **weekly** for continuous improvement

---

## **13. Documentation & Audit**
- Include **task description, acceptance criteria, attachments, and comments**  
- Maintain **centralized documentation** in SharePoint or Teams
