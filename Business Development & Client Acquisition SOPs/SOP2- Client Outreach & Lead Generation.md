---

## **End-to-End Process Flow**

### **Step 1: Market & Target Audience Research**

Before starting outreach, it’s essential to define who your ideal clients are.

**1. Define Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**

* **Industry:** IT, SaaS, FinTech, E-commerce, Healthcare Tech, EdTech, etc.
* **Company Size:** Startups to Mid-level companies (10–500 employees).
* **Decision-Makers:** Founders, CEOs, CTOs, Product Heads, HR Heads, and Project Managers.
* **Geography:** India, US, UK, Middle East, and Europe.
* **Budget Bracket:** Companies with potential project value ₹1 lakh–₹50 lakh+.

**2. Create a Prospect List**
Use tools such as:

* **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** – for targeted searches.
* **Apollo.io / RocketReach / Hunter.io** – for verified emails.
* **Clutch / GoodFirms / Upwork** – for companies seeking IT solutions.
* **Google Search + Crunchbase** – for identifying funded startups.

Maintain a **Prospect Tracker Sheet** with:

| Company Name | Industry | Contact Person | Role | Location | Email | LinkedIn | Source | Notes |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------- | ---- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ----- |

---

### **Step 2: Lead Qualification**

Not every contact is worth pursuing. Qualify your leads before outreach.

**Qualification Criteria (BANT Framework):**

* **Budget** – Do they have the financial capability?
* **Authority** – Are you speaking with the decision-maker?
* **Need** – Is there a problem your services solve?
* **Timeline** – Are they ready to engage soon?

Classify leads into:

* **Hot Lead:** Immediate project or inquiry
* **Warm Lead:** Interested, exploring options
* **Cold Lead:** Not ready now, nurture later

**Tools:** Google Sheets, Notion, CRM (HubSpot/Zoho)

---

### **Step 3: Outreach Strategy**

Outreach should be **multi-channel**, combining **LinkedIn, Email, Freelance Platforms**, and **Referrals** for higher conversion.
