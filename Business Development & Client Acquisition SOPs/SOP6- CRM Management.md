## **7. Updating & Tracking Procedure**

### **Step 1: Entering New Leads**

* Verify information (especially contact details).
* Assign the lead to the correct BD Executive.

### **Step 2: Logging Communication**

* Use CRM integrations (HubSpot Outlook/Gmail plugin or Zoho Mail) to **auto-log emails**.
* Add a summary like:

  > “Spoke with client regarding AI product. Interested in demo next week.”

### **Step 3: Updating Lead Status**

* Update status after every meaningful interaction (e.g., after sending a proposal).
* Add remarks such as:

  > “Proposal shared on 12-Oct. Awaiting feedback.”
* Never leave the status unchanged for more than **5 working days**.

### **Step 4: Setting Follow-Up Reminders**

* Follow-up frequency:

  * 1st Follow-Up: After 2 days of first contact
  * 2nd Follow-Up: After 5 days
  * 3rd Follow-Up: After 10 days (mark dormant if no response)

### **Step 5: Closing & Archiving**

* If **lost**, record the loss reason (e.g., budget, delay, competitor, unresponsive).
* Archive closed leads monthly for system efficiency.

## **8. Reporting & Dashboards**

CRM dashboards provide clear visibility into team and sales performance.

### **Standard Reports to Generate:**

2. **Conversion Rate** – % of leads converted to deals.
3. **Follow-Up Compliance** – % of leads with timely updates.
4. **Average Lead Age** – How long leads stay in the pipeline.
5. **Deal Value by Stage** – Total ₹ amount in each stage.

### **Pipeline Velocity Formula:**

[
\text{Pipeline Velocity} = \frac{Total\ Opportunities \times Win\ Rate \times Average\ Deal\ Value}{Average\ Sales\ Cycle\ Length}
]
This helps assess how fast deals are moving through the funnel.
