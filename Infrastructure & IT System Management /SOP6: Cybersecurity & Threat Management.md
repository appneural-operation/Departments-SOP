2. **Encrypt all sensitive data** in storage and during transfer.
3. **Apply software updates and security patches** weekly or as released.
4. **Segment networks** ‚Äî keep internal, guest, and development networks isolated.
5. Enable **secure VPN connections** for remote workers.
6. Implement **‚ÄúLeast Privilege‚Äù principle** ‚Äî grant only the minimum necessary access.
7. **Disable unused ports/services** on all servers and devices.
8. Use **endpoint detection & response (EDR)** systems for real-time monitoring.
9. Regularly **rotate encryption keys and passwords** (every 90 days).
10. **Monitor third-party integrations** for vulnerabilities.

---

### **Operational Best Practices**

1. Maintain **cyber hygiene checklist** for daily/weekly IT maintenance.
2. Conduct **risk assessment** bi-annually to identify emerging threats.
3. Keep a **Cyber Crisis Response Team (CCRT)** with defined roles and escalation paths.
4. Ensure **vendor security assessments** before onboarding any new third-party provider.
5. Retain **logs and audit trails for at least 1 year** for forensic analysis.
6. Use **secure password managers** for storing credentials.
7. Implement **email authentication protocols** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to prevent spoofing.

---

### **Employee Awareness Best Practices**

1. Never share passwords or OTPs via chat/email.
2. Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading attachments from unverified sources.
3. Lock screens when away from the workstation.
4. Report **any suspicious emails, pop-ups, or system behavior immediately** to IT.
