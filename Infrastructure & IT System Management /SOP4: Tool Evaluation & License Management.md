* All IT-managed software tools and platforms.
* Tools procured under company accounts or subscriptions.

---

---

## ðŸ§­ **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **1. Tool Requirement Identification**

* The requesting department identifies the need for a new tool (e.g., project management, HR software, testing tool).
* The requester fills out a **Tool Request Form** specifying:

  * Purpose and function.
  * Expected benefits or improvements.
  * Number of users/licenses required.
* Department Head reviews and forwards it to the IT Department.

---

### **2. Tool Evaluation Process**

The IT Department, along with the requesting team, evaluates the tool based on:

| **Evaluation Criteria** | **Description**                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Functionality           | Does it meet business needs and integrate with current systems?                   |
| Cost & ROI              | Subscription fee vs expected performance improvement.                             |
| Security & Compliance   | Data protection, privacy, and compliance with IT Act 2000 & GDPR (if applicable). |
| Vendor Reputation       | Reliability, customer support, and uptime guarantees.                             |
| Scalability             | Ability to support future growth or user expansion.                               |
| Technical Compatibility | OS, browser, or API compatibility.                                                |

* Create a **Tool Evaluation Report** (template below).
* Conduct **trial or pilot testing** for high-value tools (if possible).
* Final recommendation shared with Management/Finance for approval.

---

### **3. Procurement & License Activation**

* Once approved:

  * Finance or Procurement Team finalizes the vendor agreement.
  * IT activates the license or subscription and records details in the **License Inventory Register.**
* Maintain a copy of the **purchase invoice**, **vendor contract**, and **license key** in a secure repository.
* Assign the tool to authorized employees only (role-based access).

---

### **4. License Tracking & Renewal**

* Maintain a **License Tracker Sheet** with:

  * Tool Name, Vendor, License Key, Purchase Date, Renewal Date, Cost, Department, and Owner.
* IT reviews this tracker **monthly** and sends reminders for upcoming renewals **30 days in advance.**
* Finance verifies budget approval for renewal.
* Renew licenses before expiry to avoid downtime.
* Record renewal details in the tracker and archive past licenses for audit purposes.

---

### **5. Vendor Contract Management**

* Store all vendor contracts in the **Vendor Contract Repository.**
* Ensure:

  * Renewal terms, SLAs, and payment terms are clearly documented.
  * Vendor complies with data security and privacy clauses.
* Conduct **annual vendor performance reviews** to assess:

  * Service quality.
  * Cost efficiency.
  * Support response time.

---

### **6. Compliance & Audit**

* Conduct a **bi-annual software license audit** to ensure:

  * All tools are licensed and within usage limits.
  * No unauthorized tools or duplicate subscriptions exist.
* Maintain documentation for internal and external audits.
* Non-compliance (e.g., expired or unlicensed software) must be **reported to the IT Manager immediately** and corrected within 7 days.

---

### **7. Decommissioning & Replacement**

* If a tool is found **inefficient**, **redundant**, or **non-compliant**, IT proposes discontinuation.
* Record removal in the **Tool Decommission Log**.
