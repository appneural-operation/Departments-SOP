# SOP–IT–01: IT Asset Management & Access Control

### **Purpose:**

To ensure that all IT assets (hardware, software, and digital access credentials) are properly allocated, tracked, maintained, and secured throughout their lifecycle. This SOP aims to prevent data loss, unauthorized access, and misuse of company-owned IT resources.

---

### **Scope:**

This procedure applies to all employees, interns, contractors, and departments at **APPNEURAL Pvt. Ltd.** who use company-provided devices, software, or have access to company systems, cloud platforms, or confidential data.

---

### **Definitions:**

* **IT Assets:** Includes laptops, desktops, monitors, mobile devices, software licenses, tools, and access credentials.
* **Access Control:** The process of managing user access rights to systems, data, and applications.
* **Asset Register:** A master list that records details of all IT assets, ownership, and status.
* **De-provisioning:** The process of revoking access rights and recovering assets upon exit or role change.

---

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **1. Asset Procurement & Registration**

* IT Department procures hardware/software as per approved request.
* Each asset is tagged with a **unique Asset ID**.
* Details such as purchase date, vendor, cost, and warranty are recorded in the **Asset Register (Excel/Google Sheet/Asset Management Tool).**
* Software licenses are recorded in a **License Tracker Sheet.**

---

### **2. Asset Issuance to Employees**

* HR or IT team raises an **Asset Allocation Form** during onboarding.
* The employee signs an **Asset Acceptance & Responsibility Agreement.**
* IT updates the **Asset Register** with assigned employee name, department, issue date, and condition.
* For software access:

  * IT creates authorized credentials (email, project tools, etc.).
  * Role-based access is granted (least privilege principle).

---

### **3. Access Control Management**

* Maintain a **User Access Matrix** defining access levels for each department (HR, Development, BD, etc.).
* For new users: create accounts only after HR approval.
* For role changes: update permissions immediately.
* For exits: deactivate accounts within 24 hours of the employee’s last working day.
* Periodically (quarterly), review user access logs and remove inactive or redundant users.

---

### **4. Asset Monitoring & Audit**

* IT conducts **quarterly physical verification** of all company assets.
* Cross-check asset serial numbers with the Asset Register.
* Log any missing, damaged, or unused assets in the **Asset Audit Report.**
* Escalate discrepancies to HR/Operations Head.
* Review software licenses monthly for compliance and renewal dates.

---

### **5. Asset Return & De-provisioning**

* Upon resignation, termination, or project transfer:

  * HR notifies IT of employee’s last working day.
  * Employee returns all company devices in working condition.
  * IT checks for physical damage and verifies all data is backed up and wiped securely.
  * All access credentials are deactivated, and ownership is updated to “Returned.”
* Issue an **Asset Return Acknowledgment Form.**

---

### **6. Record Maintenance & Reporting**

* Maintain records of all asset transactions (issue, transfer, return) in the Asset Register.
* Keep a **Digital Backup** of all signed forms (PDF format in Google Drive > IT Assets folder).
* Prepare a **Monthly IT Asset Summary Report** for management review.
