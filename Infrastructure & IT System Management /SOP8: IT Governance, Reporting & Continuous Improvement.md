## **Detailed Process Flow**

### **Step 1: IT Governance Framework Setup**

1. Define IT governance pillars:

   * **Performance Management** (uptime, issue resolution)
   * **Policy Compliance** (adherence to internal rules)
   * **Security & Risk Control** (data safety, system access)
   * **Continuous Improvement** (process and cost optimization)

2. Define measurable KPIs for each pillar.

3. Establish review cycles (monthly performance, quarterly improvement review, annual IT audit).

4. Assign responsibilities using a **RACI Matrix** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).

**Example IT KPIs:**

| Area                | KPI                                    | Target   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| System Performance  | System uptime                          | ‚â• 99.5%  |
| Incident Management | Average ticket resolution time         | ‚â§ 24 hrs |
| Backup Success Rate | Data backup completion                 | ‚â• 98%    |
| SLA Compliance      | Vendor SLA adherence                   | ‚â• 95%    |
| Security Incidents  | Prevented or resolved within timeframe | 100%     |

---

### **Step 2: IT Performance Monitoring**

1. Use monitoring tools (e.g., **AWS CloudWatch, Zabbix, or Datadog**) to track:

   * System uptime & downtime
   * Server utilization (CPU, memory, storage)
   * Network and application performance
2. Maintain an **IT Performance Dashboard** with daily/weekly summaries.
3. Create a **Ticket Management Log** in Jira/Freshdesk/ZohoDesk for:

   * New requests and incidents
   * SLA timers
   * Resolution times and responsible person
4. Conduct **weekly operational reviews** to check deviation from KPIs.

**Example Ticket Report:**

| Date        | Ticket ID | Category         | Assigned To | Resolution Time | Status |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------ |
| 12 Oct 2025 | IT‚Äì1023   | Network          | Anil        | 5 hrs           | Closed |
| 13 Oct 2025 | IT‚Äì1028   | Software License | Ritu        | 14 hrs          | Closed |

### **Step 3: Periodic IT Reporting**

1. Reports are to be submitted **monthly** to management and **quarterly** for board review.
2. Reports must include:

   * System uptime summary
   * Ticket and SLA compliance chart
   * Backup success rate
   * Security audit results
   * Cost vs. Budget report
   * Planned vs. executed improvement projects

**Example Monthly IT Report Summary:**

| ----------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| System Uptime     | 99.5%      | 99.7%     | ‚úÖ Met                  |         |
| Tickets Resolved  | 100        | 96        | ‚ö† Slight delay         |         |
| Backup Success    | 98%        | 100%      | ‚úÖ Excellent            |         |
| Policy Compliance | 100%       | 97%       | ‚ö† Review pending users |         |
| Cost Variance     | ‚Çπ1,00,000  | ‚Çπ1,05,000 | üî∏Over by ‚Çπ5,000       |         |
