   * Major (>20%) – Immediate action required
4. Discuss variance reports in **management meetings**.
5. Identify **corrective actions**, e.g., cost-cutting, reallocations.

**Deliverable:** Monthly Budget vs Actual Report

**Template Example:**

```
Department | Budgeted Amount | Actual Amount | Variance | % Variance | Action Required | Owner
```
