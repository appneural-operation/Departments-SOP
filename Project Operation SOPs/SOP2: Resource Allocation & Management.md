**Deliverable:** Resource Requirement Sheet

**Template – Resource Requirement Sheet:**

```
Resource Requirement Sheet
---------------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Prepared By: ______________________
Date: _____________________________

Resource Type | Description | Quantity | Required Dates | Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------
Human         | Developer  | 2        | 01-Oct to 30-Oct | Front-end
Human         | QA Tester  | 1        | 15-Oct to 30-Oct | Testing
Equipment     | Laptop     | 3        | 01-Oct to 30-Oct | High-performance
Software      | Licenses   | 3        | 01-Oct to 30-Oct | IDE tools
Materials     | Server     | 1        | 01-Oct to 30-Oct | Hosting
```

**Best Practices:**

* Confirm resource requirements with **department heads**.
* Identify **critical resources early** to prevent project delays.
* Include buffer resources for **unforeseen changes**.

### **Step 2: Assign Team Members, Tools, and Materials**

**Actions:**

1. Allocate **human resources based on skillset, availability, and experience**.
2. Assign **equipment and software licenses** as required.
3. Allocate **materials and consumables** for project tasks.
4. Record allocations in a **Resource Allocation Log**.

**Deliverable:** Resource Allocation Log

**Template – Resource Allocation Log:**

```
Resource Allocation Log
------------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Prepared By: ______________________
Date: _____________________________

Resource | Assigned To | Role / Usage | Start Date | End Date | Status
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Developer | Alice      | Front-end Dev | 01-Oct     | 30-Oct   | Assigned
QA Tester | Bob        | Testing       | 15-Oct     | 30-Oct   | Assigned
Laptop    | Alice      | Equipment     | 01-Oct     | 30-Oct   | Issued
Server    | Project PM | Hosting       | 01-Oct     | 30-Oct   | Allocated
```

**Best Practices:**

* Align **resource assignment with project milestones**.
* Ensure **resource responsibilities are communicated clearly**.
* Maintain **tracking logs for accountability**.

### **Step 3: Maintain Resource Utilization Log**

**Actions:**

1. Track **actual usage vs allocated resources**.
2. Update log weekly with hours worked, equipment usage, and material consumption.
3. Identify **overutilized or underutilized resources**.

**Deliverable:** Resource Utilization Report

**Template – Resource Utilization Log:**

```
Resource Utilization Log
-------------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Week Ending: _______________________

Resource | Assigned | Actual Usage | Variance | Remarks
--------------------------------------------------------
Developer Alice | 40 hrs | 45 hrs | +5 | Extra support needed
QA Tester Bob   | 20 hrs | 18 hrs | -2 | On schedule
Laptop Alice    | 40 hrs | 40 hrs | 0 | Optimal
Server          | 24 hrs | 25 hrs | +1 | High usage
```

**Best Practices:**

* Use **resource utilization to optimize allocations**.
* Share **utilization reports with PMO and management**.
* Plan **corrective actions for over- or under-utilization**.

---

### **Step 4: Monitor Availability and Resolve Conflicts**

**Actions:**

1. Check for **resource conflicts across projects**.
2. Reassign or **adjust schedules to resolve conflicts**.
3. Escalate **critical resource shortages** to PMO or management.

**Deliverable:** Resource Conflict Resolution Report

**Template – Resource Conflict Report:**

```
Resource Conflict Report
------------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Date: ______________________________
Resource | Conflicting Projects | Proposed Action | Approved By
----------------------------------------------------------------
Developer Alice | Project A & B  | Reallocate 1 day/week | PMO Head
Server          | Project B & C  | Schedule backup time | PMO Head
```

**Best Practices:**

* Maintain **centralized resource calendar** for visibility.
* Communicate changes **promptly to all impacted teams**.
* Prioritize **critical project resources** based on business needs.
