## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Store Project Documents in Shared Repository**

**Actions:**

1. Upload all project-related documents (plans, budgets, risk registers, status reports, meeting minutes) to a **centralized repository** (Google Drive, SharePoint, or internal server).
2. Categorize documents based on **project phase** (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Closure).
3. Assign **access permissions** based on roles and responsibilities.

**Template – Document Upload Checklist:**

```
Document Upload Checklist
-------------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Project ID: ________________________
Date: ______________________________
Prepared By: _______________________

Document Name        | Category        | Uploaded By | Access Level | Version
-------------------  | --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------
Project Plan         | Planning        | PM          | Team Only    | 1.0
Risk Register        | Execution       | PMO         | Management   | 1.0
Budget Report        | Execution       | Finance     | Management   | 1.0
Lessons Learned      | Closure         | PM          | All          | 1.0
```

**Best Practices:**

* Use **consistent naming conventions** for files.
* Ensure **folder hierarchy reflects project phases**.
* Assign **read/write permissions carefully** to avoid accidental edits.

### **Step 2: Ensure Version Control**

**Actions:**

1. Maintain **version history** for all documents.
2. Update version number on **every modification** (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1).
3. Record **who made the change, date, and summary of updates**.

**Template – Version Control Log:**

```
Version Control Log
-------------------
Document Name: ______________________
Project Name: _______________________
Version | Date       | Updated By | Change Summary
--------|-----------|------------|-------------------------------
1.0     | DD/MM/YYYY | PM         | Initial upload
1.1     | DD/MM/YYYY | PMO        | Updated risk register
1.2     | DD/MM/YYYY | Finance    | Updated budget report
```

**Best Practices:**

* Use **document management tools with built-in version control** (SharePoint, Confluence).
* Avoid **multiple copies** of the same document outside repository.
* Maintain a **change log** for audit trails.

### **Step 3: Retain Project Documents per Retention Policy**

**Actions:**

1. Retain all project documents as per **company policy (e.g., 7 years)**.
2. Archive closed project folders in **read-only mode** for long-term storage.
3. Regularly review archives to ensure **compliance and accessibility**.

**Template – Document Retention Log:**

```
Document Retention Log
----------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Project ID: ________________________
Retention Period: 7 Years
Archived By: _______________________
Archive Location: __________________

Document Name       | Retention Start | Retention End | Status
------------------  | ---------------| ------------- | -------
Project Plan        | DD/MM/YYYY      | DD/MM/YYYY    | Archived

```

**Best Practices:**

* Follow **legal and regulatory retention requirements**.
* Clearly mark **archived folders as read-only**.
* Ensure **accessibility for audits**.

### **Step 4: Maintain Lessons Learned Database**

**Actions:**

1. Collect lessons learned during project closure.
2. Store in a **central knowledge database** for future reference.
3. Tag lessons by **project type, department, and category** for easy search.
4. Share lessons with **project teams, PMO, and management**.

**Template – Lessons Learned Database Entry:**

```
