---

## **Scope**

Applicable to:

* Project Managers
* Project Teams
* QA/Testing Teams
* PMO Team
* Stakeholders / Sponsors

Covers:

* Quality standards definition and audits
* Risk identification and tracking
* Mitigation plan implementation
* Escalation of critical risks or quality issues

---

## **Objective**

* Maintain **high quality of deliverables** throughout the project lifecycle.
* Identify and manage **project risks proactively**.
* Escalate **critical issues to stakeholders** for timely resolution.
* Improve **overall project efficiency and stakeholder confidence**.

---

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Step 1: Define Quality Standards & KPIs**

**Actions:**

1. Determine **quality expectations for deliverables** (functionality, accuracy, usability, etc.).
2. Define **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for measuring quality (e.g., defect rate, test pass rate).
3. Document **standards and KPIs** in a Quality Plan and share with the team.

**Deliverable:** Project Quality Plan

**Template – Quality Plan:**

```
Project Quality Plan
-------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Prepared By: ______________________
Date: ______________________________

Deliverable | Quality Standard | KPI | Target | Responsible
------------------------------------------------------------
Module A    | Functional testing 100% | Defect Rate <2% | QA Lead
Module B    | UI/UX compliance       | User Feedback >90% | Designer
Report      | Accuracy & Completeness | Error Rate <1% | Analyst
```

**Best Practices:**

* Align **quality standards with client requirements**.
* Involve **QA and project leads** in defining KPIs.
* Keep **standards realistic and measurable**.

---

### **Step 2: Conduct Periodic Quality Checks & Audits**

**Actions:**

1. Schedule **regular quality reviews and audits** (weekly, milestone-based, or phase-end).
2. Execute **checklists, testing, and peer reviews**.
3. Document **findings, defects, and improvement recommendations**.

**Deliverable:** Quality Audit Report

**Template – Quality Audit Checklist:**

```
Quality Audit Checklist
-----------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Audit Date: _________________________
Auditor: ___________________________

Item | Standard | Status (Pass/Fail) | Observations | Action Required
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Module A | Functional Test 100% | Pass | - | -
Module B | UI/UX Guidelines   | Fail | Color scheme mismatch | Redesign required
Documentation | Accuracy 100%  | Pass | - | -
```

**Best Practices:**

* Use **checklists and templates consistently**.
* Document **all findings for traceability**.
* Assign **clear owners for corrective actions**.

---

### **Step 3: Identify Potential Risks & Update Risk Register**

**Actions:**

1. Conduct **risk identification workshops** with the project team.
2. Log **potential risks, impact, probability, and mitigation strategies**.
3. Update the **Risk Register regularly** as new risks emerge.

**Deliverable:** Risk Register

**Template – Risk Register:**

```
Risk Register
-------------
Project Name: ______________________
Date: ______________________________

ID | Risk Description | Impact | Probability | Owner | Mitigation Plan | Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1  | Delay in API delivery | High | Medium | Bob | Allocate backup developer | Open
2  | Data loss during migration | High | Low | IT Team | Daily backups | Open
3  | Budget overrun | Medium | Medium | PM | Weekly expense review | In Progress
```

**Best Practices:**

* Review **risk register weekly or after major milestones**.
* Assign **owners responsible for mitigation**.
* Update **status regularly** to track resolution.

---

### **Step 4: Implement Mitigation Plans**

**Actions:**

1. Execute **mitigation strategies for identified risks**.
2. Monitor **effectiveness of mitigation actions**.
3. Adjust plans if **risk impact or probability changes**.

**Deliverable:** Mitigation Action Log

**Template – Mitigation Action Log:**

```
Mitigation Action Log
---------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Date: ______________________________

Risk ID | Mitigation Action | Owner | Start Date | Completion Date | Status | Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1       | Assign backup developer | Bob | 05-Oct | 12-Oct | Completed | API delay avoided
2       | Daily backup schedule | IT Team | 01-Oct | Ongoing | In Progress | No data loss reported
```

**Best Practices:**

* Assign **clear responsibilities and timelines**.
* Monitor **progress and effectiveness**.
* Keep **communication open with stakeholders**.

---

### **Step 5: Escalate Critical Issues**

**Actions:**

1. Identify **critical quality failures or high-impact risks**.
2. Escalate immediately to **Project Sponsor or Steering Committee**.
3. Provide **recommendations and mitigation options**.

**Deliverable:** Critical Issue Escalation Report

**Template – Critical Issue Escalation Report:**

```
Critical Issue Escalation Report
--------------------------------
Project Name: ______________________
Date: ______________________________
Reported By: ________________________

Issue Description: _______________________________________________
Impact: High / Medium / Low
Proposed Mitigation: ___________________________________________
Required Decision / Approval: _________________________________
Escalated To: __________________________
Status: Pending / In Progress / Resolved
```

**Best Practices:**

* Escalate **promptly to avoid project delays or losses**.
* Include **proposed corrective actions for faster decision-making**.
* Document **all communications for audit purposes**.

---

## **Roles & Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Oversee quality checks, monitor risk register, escalate critical issues.
* **QA Team:** Conduct audits, implement quality checks, report findings.
* **Project Team Members:** Identify risks, report issues, implement mitigation.
* **PMO / Steering Committee:** Review critical escalations, approve mitigation, monitor compliance.

---

## **Tools & Platforms**

* Risk & Issue Tracking: Jira, Trello, ClickUp
* Documentation: Google Drive, SharePoint
* Communication: Teams, Slack, Email
* Templates: Quality Plan, Audit Checklist, Risk Register, Mitigation Action Log, Escalation Report

---

## **KPIs**

* % of deliverables meeting quality standards
* Number of risks identified vs mitigated
* % of corrective actions implemented on time
* Number of critical issues escalated
* Audit compliance rate

---

## **Templates Included**

1. Project Quality Plan
2. Quality Audit Checklist
3. Risk Register
4. Mitigation Action Log
5. Critical Issue Escalation Report

---

## **Best Practices**

* Conduct **regular quality audits at defined intervals**.
