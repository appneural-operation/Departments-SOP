  * Type of service/product required
  * Purpose and timeline
  * Estimated budget
  * Technical or service specifications

**Document:** Vendor Requirement Form

---

### **Step 2: Vendor Shortlisting & Evaluation**

* Admin team sources at least **3 potential vendors** through research, referrals, or previous experience.
* Each vendor must submit:

  * Company profile
  * Quotation/proposal
  * GST and registration documents
  * Service history/references

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criteria                        | Weightage | Example                   |

| Communication & Professionalism | 10%       | Responsiveness, clarity   |

**Tool:** Vendor Evaluation Scorecard

---

### **Step 3: Vendor Selection & Approval**

* Department Head and Admin review evaluation scores.
* Top vendor is recommended for management approval.
* Once approved, Admin prepares a **Vendor Onboarding Checklist** and **Vendor Agreement**.
* Legal/HR verifies all terms (scope, payment terms, confidentiality, SLA).

**Documents:**

* Vendor Agreement (signed by both parties)
* NDA (if required)
* Vendor Onboarding Form

---

### **Step 4: Vendor Onboarding**

* Add vendor to the **Approved Vendor List (AVL)** with unique Vendor ID.
* Store all documents in the central repository (Google Drive → Admin → Vendors).
* Vendor is briefed on:

  * Work scope
  * Communication channel
  * Invoice & payment process
  * Service quality expectations

**Record Example:**

| Vendor ID | Vendor Name          | Category       | Contact        | Contract Start | Contract End | Status |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| VND-001   | TechFix IT Solutions | IT Maintenance | +91-98765XXXXX | 01/04/2025     | 31/03/2026   | Active |

---

### **Step 5: Vendor Performance Monitoring**

* Admin tracks service delivery and performance based on SLA (Service Level Agreement).
* Feedback from departments is recorded quarterly.
* Issues such as delay, non-performance, or poor quality are escalated immediately.
* Repeat issues trigger a **Vendor Performance Review** or contract termination.

**Performance Monitoring Parameters:**

| Parameter     | Measurement                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Timeliness    | Delivery vs. deadline            |
| Quality       | Product/service satisfaction     |
| Communication | Responsiveness & professionalism |
| Pricing       | Consistency & transparency       |
| Compliance    | Proper billing & GST adherence   |

---

### **Step 6: Vendor Payments & Documentation**

* Vendor submits invoice with GST and supporting documents.
* Admin verifies and forwards it to Finance for processing.
* Payment released as per contract terms (e.g., Net 15 or Net 30 days).
* Finance records payment in the **Vendor Payment Tracker**.

**Payment Flow:**
Vendor → Admin Verification → Finance Approval → Payment Release → Record in Accounts

**Documents:**

* Vendor Invoice
* Payment Voucher
* Tax/GST Certificate

---

### **Step 7: Vendor Review & Renewal**

* Conduct an **annual vendor performance review** before renewing or extending contracts.
* Vendors rated below 60% in performance are flagged for replacement.
* Vendors rated above 80% can be considered for long-term partnership.
* Renewals are done through a **Vendor Renewal Form** and management approval.

**Review Criteria:**

| Rating    | Description | Action                |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| 80–100%   | Excellent   | Renew/Extend Contract |
| 60–79%    | Average     | Conditional Renewal   |
