---

### **Process Overview**

This SOP defines the step-by-step method for executing approved projects, tracking progress, handling changes, and maintaining documentation throughout the project lifecycle.

---

### **Procedure**

#### **Step 1: Project Kickoff & Communication of Goals**

* Conduct a **Kickoff Meeting** with all stakeholders and team members.
* Present the **Project Charter** or brief that includes:

  * Project objectives and scope
  * Key milestones and timelines
  * Team roles and responsibilities
  * Expected deliverables and KPIs
* Clarify communication channels (Slack, email, project tool, etc.) and meeting frequency.

**Output:** Approved and shared project kickoff summary
**Responsibility:** Project Manager
**Timeline:** Within 3 days of project approval

**Best Practice:** Share a **Kickoff Deck** with visuals of the project roadmap and RACI matrix.

---

#### **Step 2: Task Breakdown and Scheduling**

* Break down the project into smaller, actionable tasks using a **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).**
* Assign owners, define deadlines, and set interdependencies.
* Record all tasks in a project management tool (e.g., ClickUp, Jira, Asana, or Notion).

**Output:** Detailed Task Tracker with owners and deadlines
**Responsibility:** Project Manager & Team Leads

**Best Practice:** Maintain a buffer of 10–15% time for unforeseen delays.

---

#### **Step 3: Daily / Weekly Progress Monitoring**

* Track progress of tasks and milestones daily using project management dashboards.
* Conduct **Weekly Review Meetings** with the team to review:

  * Task completion status
  * Delays or blockers
  * Resource utilization
  * Client/stakeholder feedback (if applicable)
* Update the **Progress Tracker** and escalate issues promptly if deviations are noted.

**Output:** Weekly Progress Report
**Responsibility:** Project Manager & Team Members

**Best Practice:** Use **Kanban boards or burndown charts** for visual progress tracking.

---

#### **Step 4: Resource, Task, and Deliverable Tracking**

* Continuously monitor:

  * **Human resources** – workload, task distribution, and availability
  * **Material/tools** – software licenses, server access, and data requirements
  * **Deliverables** – progress against quality benchmarks and due dates
* Record utilization and variances in a **Resource Utilization Log.**

**Output:** Resource Tracking Sheet & Deliverable Report
**Responsibility:** Project Manager & Department Heads

**Best Practice:** Conduct mid-cycle reviews to reassign tasks for balance and efficiency.

---

#### **Step 5: Documentation of Activities and Deviations**

* Maintain documentation for all project activities:

  * Meeting minutes, status reports, and progress updates
  * Any issues, delays, or deviations from plan
  * Change requests, risk logs, and resolutions
* Store documents in a **shared repository** with version control (Google Drive, Notion, or internal server).

**Output:** Centralized Project Documentation Folder
**Responsibility:** Operations Team & Project Manager

**Best Practice:** Keep a **“Decision Log”** to track what decisions were made, when, and by whom.

---

#### **Step 6: Change Management for Scope Adjustments**

* Any changes in **scope, cost, or timeline** must follow the formal **Change Request Process (CRP).**

  * Document the change request with justification.
  * Evaluate its impact on budget, resources, and deliverables.
  * Seek approval from the Change Control Board or Department Head.
  * Update the project plan and communicate approved changes to all stakeholders.

**Output:** Approved Change Request Form & Updated Project Plan
**Responsibility:** Project Manager & Department Head

**Best Practice:** Limit change requests per quarter to avoid “scope creep.”

---

#### **Step 7: Continuous Review & Reporting**

* Share **bi-weekly or monthly status reports** with senior management summarizing:

  * Progress achieved vs. targets
  * Risks, issues, and mitigation actions
  * Budget utilization (in ₹ Indian Rupees)
  * Upcoming milestones

**Output:** Monthly Performance Dashboard
**Responsibility:** Project Manager & Operations Team

---

### **Best Practices**

✅ Always maintain written records of approvals, changes, and communications.
✅ Use project management tools for task visibility and accountability.
✅ Review KPIs regularly and take corrective action early.
✅ Ensure all deliverables pass quality and compliance checks.
✅ Foster open communication to quickly identify blockers.
