### **Step 1: KPI Definition**

**Actions:**

1. Align KPIs with **strategic objectives** and department goals.
2. Ensure **SMART criteria**:

   * **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
   * **Measurable**: Quantifiable
   * **Achievable**: Realistic targets
   * **Relevant**: Supports strategic objectives
   * **Time-bound**: Defined review period
3. Categorize KPIs:

   * **Leading KPIs:** Predictive measures (e.g., training completion rate)
   * **Lagging KPIs:** Outcome measures (e.g., quarterly revenue, production efficiency)
4. Assign KPI **owners** for accountability.

**Template: KPI Definition Form**

| Department | KPI                   | Type (Leading/Lagging) | Target   | Measurement Method | Frequency | Owner              |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| Sales      | Monthly Revenue       | Lagging                | $100,000 | ERP Reports        | Monthly   | Sales Head         |
| Operations | Production Efficiency | Leading                | 95%      | Production Logs    | Weekly    | Operations Manager |

**Best Practices:**

* Keep **10–15 KPIs per department maximum** to avoid dilution.
* Use a mix of **quantitative and qualitative KPIs**.
* Involve **stakeholders** when defining KPIs to ensure relevance.

### **Step 2: Data Collection**

**Actions:**

1. Identify **data sources**: ERP, CRM, spreadsheets, dashboards, surveys.
2. Collect data at **predetermined intervals** (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly).
3. Validate data for **accuracy, completeness, and consistency**.
4. Store data centrally for **audit and analysis**.

**Template: KPI Data Collection Log**

| Date        | Department | KPI             | Actual Value | Source | Notes           |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------ | --------------- |
| 17-Oct-2025 | Sales      | Monthly Revenue | $95,000      | ERP    | 5% below target |

**Best Practices:**

* Automate data collection where possible to reduce errors.
* Keep a **backup of raw data** for verification.
* Use **real-time dashboards** for ongoing monitoring.

---

### **Step 3: Performance Analysis**

**Actions:**

1. Compare **actual performance vs targets** for each KPI.
2. Calculate **variance (%)** and identify trends:

**Formula:**

```text
Variance (%) = ((Actual - Target) / Target) * 100
```

3. Highlight areas **meeting, exceeding, or below target**.
4. Identify **root causes** for gaps.

**Template: KPI Variance Analysis**

| Department | KPI             | Target   | Actual  | Variance (%) | Status          | Action Required       |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Sales      | Monthly Revenue | $100,000 | $95,000 | -5%          | Needs Attention | Launch marketing push |

**Best Practices:**

* Set **thresholds** for acceptable variance (e.g., ±5%).
* Focus on **trend analysis**, not just a single period.
* Link underperformance to **actionable insights**.

---

### **Step 4: Reporting & Visualization**

**Actions:**

1. Prepare **performance dashboards** with visual indicators:

   * Bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, trendlines
2. Generate **periodic reports**:

   * Daily/weekly for operational monitoring
   * Monthly/quarterly for management review
3. Highlight **performance trends, variances, and corrective actions**.

**Template: KPI Dashboard Summary**

| KPI                   | Target   | Actual  | Variance | Status             |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Monthly Revenue       | $100,000 | $95,000 | -5%      | ⚠️ Needs Attention |
| Production Efficiency | 95%      | 97%     | +2%      | ✅ On Track         |

**Best Practices:**

* Use **color-coded visuals** for quick status recognition.
* Include **trend indicators** for historical comparison.
* Make dashboards **interactive** if possible (filter by department, project, period).

### **Step 5: Feedback & Corrective Actions**

**Actions:**

1. Share KPI reports with **department heads and management**.
2. Identify causes for **underperformance**.
3. Develop **corrective or preventive action plans**.
4. Assign **owners and deadlines** for action items.
5. Monitor implementation in subsequent KPI tracking cycles.

**Template: KPI Action Log**

| KPI             | Issue        | Root Cause | Action Plan               | Owner      | Deadline    | Status      |
| --------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |

### **Step 6: Documentation & Recordkeeping**

**Actions:**

* Store all KPI definitions, raw data, dashboards, and reports centrally.
* Maintain records for **at least 1–3 years** for audit and trend analysis.
* Version control for all KPI and reporting templates.

**Best Practices:**

* Use a **centralized digital repository** (SharePoint, Google Drive, or ERP).
* Keep a **change log** for KPI modifications.
* Ensure **data security and access control** for sensitive KPIs.

---

## **5. Key Controls**

* KPI alignment with **strategic objectives**.
* Validation of data **before reporting**.
* Variance > ±10% triggers **mandatory management review**.
* KPI changes require **management approval**.
