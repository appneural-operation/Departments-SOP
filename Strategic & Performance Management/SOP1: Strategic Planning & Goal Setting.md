#  **SOP: Strategic Planning & Goal Setting**

---

## **Purpose**

To guide APPNEURAL Pvt. Ltd. in creating a clear, structured, and achievable plan that defines where the company wants to go (vision), what it wants to achieve (goals), and how it will get there (strategy).

This SOP ensures everyone — from top management to team members — works toward the same direction with measurable targets.

---

## **Scope**

This SOP applies to:

* **Management & Founders** – for vision, mission, and company-wide goals
* **Department Heads** – for defining departmental and team objectives
* **HR Department** – for goal alignment, documentation, and tracking progress
* **All Employees** – to understand company goals and their contribution

---

## **Why This Is Important**

Without clear goals, teams lose direction.
This SOP ensures:

* Everyone knows **“What to achieve”** and **“Why”**
* Efforts are aligned and measurable
* Resources are used wisely
* Success is monitored and improved continuously

## **Step-by-Step Process**

---

### **Step 1: Environmental & Business Analysis**

Before setting goals, understand the environment you’re working in.

**Activities:**

1. Conduct a **SWOT Analysis**:

   * **Strengths** – What we’re good at (e.g., strong tech team)
   * **Weaknesses** – What needs improvement (e.g., limited marketing reach)
   * **Opportunities** – What we can capitalize on (e.g., AI adoption in India)
   * **Threats** – Risks or competition (e.g., fast-moving startups)
2. Review **Market Trends**, **Competitor Performance**, and **Customer Needs**.
3. Assess **Internal Capabilities** — team skills, finance, tools, and technology.

**Output:**
A clear summary of internal and external factors to consider before planning.

**Example:**

> APPNEURAL identifies a growing demand for GenAI-based solutions in the Indian SME sector — a key opportunity for FY2025.

---

### **Step 2: Align with Vision & Mission**

Once the analysis is done, ensure the goals align with the company’s vision and mission.

* **Vision Example:** “To be India’s most trusted AI-powered IT solutions provider.”
* **Mission Example:** “Deliver innovative, affordable, and reliable digital transformation services for global businesses.”

**How to Align:**

* Every goal must directly or indirectly support this mission.
* Avoid unrelated objectives that don’t add long-term value.

---

### **Step 3: Define Strategic Objectives**

Now translate the vision into clear, company-wide objectives.

**Characteristics of Good Objectives (SMART Framework):**

* **Specific:** Clearly defined (e.g., “Launch 2 SaaS products”)
* **Measurable:** Quantifiable progress (₹, %, #)
* **Achievable:** Realistic based on resources
* **Relevant:** Linked to company goals
* **Time-bound:** Has a deadline

**Example Company Objectives (FY2025):**

| Objective                   | KPI                      | Target                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Expand AI service revenue   | Sales Revenue            | ₹50 lakh by Q4          |
| Improve team efficiency     | Productivity Score       | 90% by Q3               |
| Enhance client satisfaction | NPS (Net Promoter Score) | 8.5/10                  |
| Strengthen online presence  | Website traffic          | 2x increase by year-end |

---

### **Step 4: Departmental Goal Cascading**

Once company goals are finalized, they must be **broken down** into smaller departmental goals.

**Example Cascade:**

| Level       | Goal                               | Responsible     | KPI              | Timeline   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Company     | Achieve ₹50 lakh revenue           | CEO             | ₹50 lakh         | FY25       |
| Sales Dept. | Acquire 25 new clients             | Sales Head      | 25 clients       | Q4         |
| Marketing   | Generate 100 qualified leads/month | Marketing Lead  | 100/month        | Monthly    |
| Tech Dept.  | Deliver 95% projects on time       | Project Manager | 95% on-time rate | Continuous |
| HR          | Reduce attrition to below 10%      | HR Head         | <10%             | FY25       |

This ensures **every department’s effort contributes to the bigger goal**.

---

### **Step 5: Review & Approval**

* The **management team** reviews all departmental goals for feasibility.
* Check for alignment, resource needs, and dependencies.
* Finalize and approve the **Strategic Plan Document**.

**Document Includes:**

* Company Vision, Mission
* SWOT Summary
* Annual Objectives
* Departmental Goals
* Key Metrics (KPI Dashboard)

---

### **Step 6: Implementation & Tracking**

Once approved, implementation begins.

**Monitoring Tools:**

* Google Sheets / HRMS Goal Tracker
* Weekly Review Meetings
* Monthly KPI Scorecards
* Dashboard (Power BI, Notion, or Excel)

**Tracking Example:**

| Department | Goal                 | Status   | % Completion | Remarks                |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Sales      | 25 new clients       | On Track | 60%          | Pipeline strong        |
| HR         | 10% attrition        | Achieved | 100%         | Retention improved     |
| Dev        | 95% on-time delivery | At Risk  | 75%          | Need 1 extra developer |

---

### **Step 7: Quarterly & Annual Review**

* Conduct **Quarterly Performance Review Meetings**.
* Compare actual performance vs targets.
* Identify what worked and what didn’t.
* Create a **Continuous Improvement Plan**.

**Example:**

> Sales target missed due to lack of leads → Action: Strengthen LinkedIn outreach strategy.

---

### **Step 8: Documentation & Reporting**

Keep all plans and reviews properly stored.

**Documents to Maintain:**

* Strategic Plan (Approved Copy)
* Departmental Goals Tracker
* Quarterly Reports
* Lessons Learned Sheet

**Retention Period:** Minimum **3 years** for audit/reference.

**Storage Location:** Shared Drive → `APPNEURAL/SOPs/Strategic_Planning/FY25`
