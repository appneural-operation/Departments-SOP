## **Workflow: End-to-End Asset Lifecycle**

### **Step 1: Asset Procurement**

* HR/Admin identifies asset requirements based on department requests.

### **Step 2: Asset Issuance**

* Department Head approves the request.
* HR/Admin issues asset after verifying availability.
* Employee signs **Asset Handover Form / Acknowledgment Slip**.

**Record Example:**

| -------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- |

### **Step 3: Asset Usage & Maintenance**

* Employees must use assets **solely for official work** and maintain them in good condition.
* Periodic checks every 3 months by IT/Admin for system updates, antivirus, or maintenance needs.
* Any damage or malfunction must be reported immediately via **Asset Issue Ticket**.

**Maintenance Record Example:**

| Date       | Asset ID | Type of Service  | Performed By | Remarks   |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |

### **Step 4: Asset Tracking & Audit**

* Annual physical audit by IT/Admin and reconciliation with the Asset Register.
* Missing or damaged assets are escalated for management review.

**Tools:** Google Sheet / HRMS / Asset Tracking Software (like Zoho or Excel).

---

### **Step 5: Asset Return / Recovery**

* During **resignation, termination, or internship completion**, HR initiates the asset recovery process.
* Employee must return all issued items before the final clearance.
* IT verifies condition and resets devices (factory reset, data wipe).
* HR updates Asset Register as “Returned” and closes the record.

**Return Record Example:**

| Asset ID | Employee Name | Return Date | Condition | Verified By | Remarks           |
