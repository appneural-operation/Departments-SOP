   * Quality reports vs. contractual KPIs.
   * Security and confidentiality clauses.
2. Use **Contract Compliance Checklist** during monthly audits.
3. Identify any deviation and log it as **Contract Non-Compliance Incident (CNI)**.

---

### **Phase 4: Reporting & Escalation of Deviations**

**Objective:** Escalate and resolve contract deviations promptly.

**Steps:**

1. All deviations are recorded in the **CNI Register**.
2. Classify issues as:

   * **Minor:** Operational deviation (e.g., missed report format).
   * **Major:** SLA failure or timeline breach.
   * **Critical:** Data/privacy or regulatory violation.
3. Notify responsible departments for corrective action.
4. Escalate per matrix below:

| Severity | Escalate To               | Action Timeline             |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Minor    | Account Manager           | 3 business days             |

| Critical | Director / Legal / Client | Immediate (within 24 hours) |

5. Critical issues are communicated to the **client** with mitigation steps and impact analysis.

**Output:** CNI log, escalation records, client notification (if required).

---

### **Phase 5: Corrective & Preventive Action (CAPA)**

**Objective:** Correct deviations and prevent recurrence.

**Steps:**

1. Conduct root cause analysis (RCA) for each major/critical CNI.
2. Develop CAPA plan:

   * **Corrective:** Immediate fix
   * **Preventive:** Process/system improvement
3. Assign CAPA owner and deadline.
4. Compliance verifies CAPA effectiveness.

**Output:** CAPA Tracker, RCA report, verification records.

---

### **Phase 6: Contract Renewal & Review**

**Objective:** Review and improve compliance before renewal or closure.

**Steps:**

1. 90 days before contract renewal, conduct a **Contract Compliance Audit**.
2. Review:

   * All obligations met
   * Unresolved CNIs
   * Performance vs. KPIs
3. Recommend corrective actions or updates to contract terms.
4. Prepare **Renewal Readiness Report (RRR)** for management approval.

**Output:** Compliance audit report, renewal readiness report.

---

### **Phase 7: Documentation & Archival**

**Objective:** Ensure all contract and compliance records are secure and audit-ready.

**Steps:**

1. Store all contracts, amendments, and compliance reports in the **Contract Repository**.
2. Maintain version control for all documents.
3. Ensure only authorized personnel (Compliance, Legal, Directors) can access contracts.
4. Retain records for **minimum 7 years** or as per legal requirements.

**Output:** Centralized contract repository, access logs.
