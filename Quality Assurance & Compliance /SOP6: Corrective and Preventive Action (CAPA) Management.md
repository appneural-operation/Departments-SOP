#  **SOP 6: Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Management**

---

## **1. Purpose**

To establish a structured, traceable, and systematic process for **identifying, recording, investigating, and resolving issues** through **Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA)**.

This ensures continuous improvement, compliance with policies and standards, and prevention of recurring non-conformities in operations, quality, safety, or data management.

---

## **2. Objectives**

1. Identify and analyze the **root causes** of non-conformities, deviations, or audit findings.
2. Implement **corrective actions** to eliminate immediate issues.
3. Establish **preventive actions** to avoid recurrence.
4. Monitor CAPA effectiveness and document all activities for traceability.
5. Ensure alignment with **ISO 9001**, **ISO 27001**, and internal audit standards.

---

## **3. Scope**

This SOP applies to all:

* Departments (Operations, QA, HR, IT, Admin, Finance).
* Internal audits, client audits, incident reports, and process deviations.
* Non-conformities arising from **client complaints, quality checks, security breaches**, or **regulatory audits**.

## **6. End-to-End Workflow Process**

---

### **Phase 1: Issue Identification**

**Objective:** Detect deviations, incidents, or non-conformities that require CAPA.

**Sources of CAPA Triggers:**

* Internal/External Audit findings
* Client complaints
* Quality inspection failures
* SLA or compliance violations
* IT/Data security breaches
* Process or policy non-adherence

**Steps:**

1. Employee or auditor identifies an issue and records it in the **CAPA Request Form**.
2. QA/Compliance reviews and assigns a CAPA ID.
3. Initial categorization:

   * **Minor:** No impact on client/compliance.
   * **Major:** Operational or reputational risk.
   * **Critical:** Legal, security, or client-impacting issue.

**Output:** CAPA Request Form, CAPA ID generated.

---

### **Phase 2: Containment Action**

**Objective:** Immediately control or stop the effect of the problem.

**Steps:**

1. Department Head implements a **temporary containment measure** (e.g., pause process, restrict access, notify client).
2. Record containment action in the CAPA Form.
3. DPO or QA confirms containment effectiveness.

**Output:** Containment Log, Initial Incident Report.

---

### **Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**

**Objective:** Identify the actual cause(s) behind the problem — not just the symptoms.

**Methods to Use:**

* **5 Whys Technique**
* **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram**
* **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)**

**Steps:**

1. Form an **RCA Team** (QA, Department Lead, Process Expert).
2. Collect all relevant data (logs, records, communications).
3. Conduct RCA meeting and document:

   * Problem statement
   * Immediate cause
   * Underlying/systemic cause
4. Validate findings with CAPA Owner & Compliance Head.

**Output:** RCA Report (approved by QA/Compliance).

---

### **Phase 4: CAPA Planning**

**Objective:** Develop detailed action plans for correction and prevention.

**Steps:**

1. Define two streams:

   * **Corrective Action:** What to do to fix the existing issue.
   * **Preventive Action:** What to change to avoid recurrence.
2. Document:

   * Actions
   * Responsible owner
   * Target dates
   * Expected outcomes
3. Obtain approval from Quality & Compliance Head.

**Output:** CAPA Plan Document.

---

### **Phase 5: CAPA Implementation**

**Objective:** Execute approved CAPA actions within timelines.

**Steps:**

1. CAPA Owner ensures corrective and preventive actions are implemented.
2. Update progress in **CAPA Tracker** weekly.
3. QA verifies implementation with supporting evidence (screenshots, updated SOPs, system changes).
4. Non-performing CAPAs are escalated per escalation matrix.

**Output:** CAPA Implementation Log, Updated CAPA Tracker.

---

### **Phase 6: Verification & Effectiveness Check**

**Objective:** Confirm that CAPA resolved the root cause and is effective long-term.

**Steps:**

1. QA/Compliance conducts follow-up review after **15–30 days** of CAPA closure.
2. Verify:

   * Has the issue recurred?
   * Are updated controls/SOPs working as intended?
3. Mark CAPA as:

   * **Effective** (no recurrence for 30 days).
   * **Partially Effective** (further improvement needed).
   * **Ineffective** (reopen CAPA).

**Output:** Verification Record, Effectiveness Assessment Report.

---

### **Phase 7: CAPA Closure & Reporting**

**Objective:** Formally close CAPA after verification and update stakeholders.

**Steps:**

1. QA/Compliance approves closure in the **CAPA Tracker**.
2. Notify relevant departments and record final comments.
3. Update in **Monthly CAPA Dashboard** for management.
4. Closed CAPA records are archived for **minimum 5 years**.

**Output:** Closed CAPA Record, Monthly CAPA Summary Report.
