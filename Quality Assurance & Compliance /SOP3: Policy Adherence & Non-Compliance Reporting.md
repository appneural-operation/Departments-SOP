2. Use **checklists** or **system analytics** (e.g., workflow compliance reports, system access logs).
3. Compare operational practices against approved SOPs.
4. Record any **non-adherence observation** in the **Non-Compliance Tracker (NCT)**.

**Outputs:** Compliance scorecards, adherence reports, and observation logs.

---

### **Phase 3: Detection of Non-Compliance**

**Objective:** Identify violations proactively and through transparent reporting mechanisms.

**Sources of Detection:**

* Internal audits and process reviews

* **Email Reporting:** To `compliance@[organization].com`
* **Online Form:** “Non-Compliance Reporting Form” (via intranet portal)
* **Anonymous Channel:** Confidential submission for sensitive cases

---

### **Phase 4: Reporting & Classification**

**Objective:** Register, categorize, and escalate non-compliance incidents.

**Steps:**

1. Reporter submits **Non-Compliance Report (NCR)** with details (who, what, when, where, why).
2. Compliance Officer logs the case in the **Non-Compliance Register**.
3. Classify the case as:

| Category              | Description                              | Examples                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Minor NC**          | Deviation without significant impact     | Missed form signature, outdated template |
| **Major NC**          | Operational or client-impacting issue    | Missed QA check before delivery          |
| **Critical NC**       | Regulatory, legal, or security violation | Data breach, unauthorized access         |
| **Observation (OFI)** | Opportunity for improvement              | Process efficiency suggestion            |

4. Assign an **investigation owner** (Department Head or QA).

**Outputs:** Registered NCR, classification summary, and initial risk rating.

---

### **Phase 5: Investigation & Root Cause Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. Draft CAPA plan including:

   * **Immediate Fix** (Corrective)
   * **Systemic Change** (Preventive)
2. Assign owner and completion deadline.
3. Compliance verifies CAPA implementation through follow-up checks.
4. Update SOPs or training materials if required.

**Outputs:** CAPA Register, verification records, updated policies.

2. Hold **monthly management review** to discuss trends, unresolved issues, and systemic risks.
3. Record actions in **Management Review Minutes**.

**Outputs:** Escalation log, review minutes, and decision outcomes.

---

### **Phase 8: Reporting, Closure & Documentation**

**Objective:** Ensure all non-compliance cases are closed and documented for audit readiness.

**Steps:**

1. Update the **Non-Compliance Tracker** with resolution details and evidence.
2. Verify CAPA effectiveness before closure.
3. Archive reports in the **Compliance Document Repository**.
4. Generate monthly **Compliance Performance Report** showing:

   * Number of non-compliance incidents
   * Closure rate
   * Repeat issues
   * High-risk areas

**Outputs:** Final compliance reports, dashboards, and closure records.
