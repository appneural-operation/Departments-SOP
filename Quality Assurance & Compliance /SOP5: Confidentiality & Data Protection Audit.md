2. For confirmed breaches:

   * Conduct **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**.
   * Notify impacted clients (if required by contract or law).
   * Report to authorities (if under GDPR/PDPA) within 72 hours.

**Escalation Matrix:**

| Severity               | Escalate To               | Response Time        |
